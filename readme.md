Add to Favorite: Users can click on the "Add to Favorite" button to add a movie to their favorites list. The movie details are stored in the browser's local storage.

Remove from Favorite: If a movie is already added to the favorites list, the "Remove from Favorite" button allows users to remove it from the list.

Display Favorite Movies: When the page loads, the app displays the user's favorite movies stored in the local storage.
